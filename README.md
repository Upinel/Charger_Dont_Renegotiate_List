[^Belkin]:  DPs saying it disconnects [1](https://old.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/r9r1nf/normal_for_usb_c_multiport_chargers_to/iflcr3n/), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypPZszqLxts)
[^SlimQ]:  if you exceed 100w then all get disconnected until you unplug and replug
[^ISDT]: All its USBC port are seperate 65W with max 200W in total. So there will be no disconnect at all. It also have a screen that shows current power draw of each ports. But the clock on the screen is not accurate.
[^Ugreen]: all Ugreens disconnect
[^Anker2]: but it's superfast at reconnecting
[^Asometech]: there are three zones, it only disconnects if you plug into the same zone
